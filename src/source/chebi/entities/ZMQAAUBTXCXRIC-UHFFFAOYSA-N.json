It is found in several plants, including black pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg, and is present in several essential oils, notably that of sassafras. It has insecticidal properties and has been used as a topical antiseptic. Although not thought to pose a significant carcinogenic risk to humans, findings of weak carcinogenicity in rats have resulted in the banning of its (previously widespread) use in perfumes and soaps, and as a food additive.",
